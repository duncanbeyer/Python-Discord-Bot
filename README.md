# Discord Music Bot

This bot was written by myself with a little help from the internet. The help is just in the form of finding plugins to access information and interact with the discord and YouTube APIs.

This project came about because YouTube changed their policies, so the discord music bots my friends and I had been using no longer supported Youtube links.

I wrote the logic of this bot to match that of the FredBoat music bot that we used to use. The ;;play, ;;skip, and ;;stop commands for this bot work identically to how FredBoat used to work. 

# Constraints of Use:
If all you do with this bot is use ;;play with a YouTube link, it will work flawlessly. It does not yet have support for searching for a song using keywords, which I may implement later. 

# Legal Disclaimer
This is merely an example of a bot that would excel at downloading and playing songs from YouTube. I would NEVER actually do that as it breaks the YouTube TOS 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
